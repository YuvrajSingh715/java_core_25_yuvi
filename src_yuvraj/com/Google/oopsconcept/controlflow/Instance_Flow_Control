🔥 Instance Flow Control – Interview Points 🚀
=============================================

 - Instance flow control is executed when an object is created 🧱, not when the class is loaded 📦.

 - During object creation, instance variables and instance blocks execute before the constructor ⏳.

 - Execution order inside a class is 👇
   --> Instance Variables ➡️ Instance Blocks ➡️ Constructor

 - Execution follows top-to-bottom order ⬇️ as written in the class.

 - In inheritance, parent class instance members execute before child class instance members 👨‍👦.

 - Parent class constructor executes before child class constructor 🏗️.

 - Overridden methods are called based on runtime object 🔁, even if invoked from parent instance blocks or constructors.

 - Forward reference is NOT allowed ❌ in instance variable initialization or instance blocks.

 - Instance flow is executed every time an object is created 🔄.

 - Instance blocks are mainly used for common initialization code ⚙️.
